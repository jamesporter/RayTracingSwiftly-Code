# RayTracingSwiftly-Code

Unit Tests and sample solutions code for [The Ray Tracer Challenge](https://pragprog.com/book/jbtracer/the-ray-tracer-challenge)

I gave up at the refraction bit as I found it was getting a bit tedious! (In part because I had to write out these tests which you can just copy).

I did some basic optimisation/caching of transforms which *massively* improvded performance.

Includes reflections and shadows.

The solutions probably shouldn't be used directly but can be consulted.

I also included a View Controller for very basic MacApp that can run things/show results. You'll need to create your own UI etc if you want to use this.
